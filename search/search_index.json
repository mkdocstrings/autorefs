Installation \u00a4 With pip : python3 -m pip install mkdocs-autorefs Usage \u00a4 # mkdocs.yml plugins : - search - autorefs In one of your Markdown files (e.g. doc1.md ) create some headings: ## Hello, world! ## Another heading Link to [ Hello, World! ]( #hello-world ) on the same page. This is a normal link to an anchor . MkDocs generates anchors for each heading, and they can always be used to link to something, either within the same page (as shown here) or by specifying the path of the other page. But with this plugin, you can link to a heading from any other page on the site without needing to know the path of either of the pages, just the heading title itself. Let's create another Markdown page to try this, subdir/doc2.md : We can [ link to that heading ][ hello-world ] from another page too. This works the same as [ a normal link to that heading ]( ../doc1.md#hello-world ). Linking to a heading without needing to know the destination page can be useful if specifying that path is cumbersome, e.g. when the pages have deeply nested paths, are far apart, or are moved around frequently. And the issue is somewhat exacerbated by the fact that MkDocs supports only relative links between pages . Note that this plugin's behavior is undefined when trying to link to a heading title that appears several times throughout the site. Currently it arbitrarily chooses one of the pages. Requirements \u00a4 mkdocs-autorefs requires Python 3.6 or above. To install Python 3.6, I recommend using pyenv . # install pyenv git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv ~/.pyenv # setup pyenv (you should also put these three lines in .bashrc or similar) export PATH = \" ${ HOME } /.pyenv/bin: ${ PATH } \" export PYENV_ROOT = \" ${ HOME } /.pyenv\" eval \" $( pyenv init - ) \" # install Python 3.6 pyenv install 3 .6.12 # make it available globally pyenv global system 3 .6.12","title":"Overview"},{"location":"#mkdocs-autorefs","text":"Automatically link across pages in MkDocs.","title":"mkdocs-autorefs"},{"location":"#installation","text":"With pip : python3 -m pip install mkdocs-autorefs","title":"Installation"},{"location":"#usage","text":"# mkdocs.yml plugins : - search - autorefs In one of your Markdown files (e.g. doc1.md ) create some headings: ## Hello, world! ## Another heading Link to [ Hello, World! ]( #hello-world ) on the same page.

Every little bit helps, and credit will always be given. Environment setup \u00a4 Nothing easier! Fork and clone the repository, then: cd mkdocs-autorefs make setup Note If it fails for some reason, you'll need to install Poetry manually. You can install it with: python3 -m pip install --user pipx pipx install poetry Now you can try running make setup again, or simply poetry install . You now have the dependencies installed. Run make help to see all the available actions! Tasks \u00a4 This project uses duty to run tasks. A Makefile is also provided. The Makefile will try to run certain tasks on multiple Python versions. If for some reason you don't want to run the task on multiple Python versions, you can do one of the following: export PYTHON_VERSIONS= : this will run the task with only the current Python version run the task directly with poetry run duty TASK , or duty TASK if the environment was already activated through poetry shell The Makefile detects if the Poetry environment is activated, so make will work the same with the virtualenv activated or not. Development \u00a4 As usual: create a new branch: git checkout -b feature-or-bugfix-name edit the code and/or the documentation If you updated the documentation or the project dependencies: run make docs-regen run make docs-serve , go to http://localhost:8000 and check that everything looks good Before committing: run make format to auto-format the code run make check to check everything (fix any warning) run make test to run the tests (fix any issue) follow our commit message convention If you are unsure about how to fix or ignore a warning, just let the continuous integration fail, and we will help you during review. Don't bother updating the changelog, we will take care of this. Commit message convention \u00a4 Commits messages must follow the Angular style : <type>[(scope)]: Subject [Body] Scope and body are optional. Type can be: build : About packaging, building wheels, etc. chore : About packaging or repo/files management. ci : About Continuous Integration. docs : About documentation. feat : New feature. fix : Bug fix. perf : About performance. refactor : Changes which are not features nor bug fixes. style : A change in code style/format. tests : About tests. Subject (and body) must be valid Markdown. If you write a body, please add issues references at the end: Body. References: #10, #11. Fixes #15. Pull requests guidelines \u00a4 Link to any related issue in the Pull Request message. During review, we recommend using fixups: # SHA is the SHA of the commit you want to fix git commit --fixup = SHA Once all the changes are approved, you can squash your commits: git rebase -i --autosquash master And force-push: git push -f If this seems all too complicated, you can push or force-push each new commit, and we will squash them ourselves if needed, before merging.","title":"Contributing"},{"location":"contributing/#contributing","text":"Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated!
